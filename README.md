# Portfolio


Technologies Used:
For this project, I chose to use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a static website. This approach allowed me to focus on the fundamentals of web development and gain a deeper understanding of how these technologies work together.
HTML:
I used HTML5 to structure the content of my website. It allowed me to define the structure and content of my portfolio, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
CSS:
To style my website, I used CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It allowed me to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of my portfolio.
JavaScript
I included JavaScript to add some interactivity and dynamic elements to the portfolio. JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

Challenges Faced:
Responsive Design: One of the main challenges I faced was making the website responsive. I learned about media queries and flexible layouts to ensure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
CSS Layouts: Positioning elements exactly where I wanted them proved to be trickier than I initially thought. I spent time learning about flexbox and grid layouts to achieve the desired results.
Version Control: Using Git and GitHub for version control was new to me. I had to learn basic Git commands and how to push my changes to GitHub.

New Skills Acquired

GitHub Pages: I learned how to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages. 
Web Performance: I gained insights into web performance optimization, including minimizing CSS and compressing images to improve load times.


Reflections:
I enjoyed the process of seeing my design come to life as I coded. The immediate feedback loop of making changes and seeing the results in the browser was satisfying. I also appreciated the control that comes with hand-coding a website, as opposed to using a website builder.
However, the process of making the site fully responsive was more time-consuming than I anticipated. In future projects, I might consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap to streamline this process.In the future, I'd like to, add more interactive elements using JavaScript.
